    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>E-commerce Website (React)</h3>
    <p>
      I had the opportunity to collaborate on the design and development of a
      streamlined e-commerce website. Leveraging React.js, Bootstrap, and
      MongoDB, we created a dynamic and responsive user interface featuring over
      15 product listings and an efficient checkout process. This project
      allowed me to showcase my skills in front-end development and my ability
      to work effectively in a team environment.

      I successfully built a user-friendly website that connects parents with a
      childcare facility. By implementing both front-end and back-end
      functionality using PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQL, I demonstrated my
      proficiency in full-stack web development. This project highlighted my
      ability to deliver a functional and visually appealing website that meets
      the needs of its target audience.
